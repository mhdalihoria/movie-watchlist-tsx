## Why this project?

- "Movie Watchlist" is a Solo project provided by [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) to allow the students to challenge their knowledge to create unique web apps. 

- Solo projects are projects where you're only provided by a [Figma](https://www.figma.com) design and the student is left to make a pixel-perfect, fully functional web app.

- As mentioned above, this project is a remake of an older-vanillaJS version of this solo project, to practice my React skills as well as my TypeScript knowledge.

- This version of the project brought a better UX/UI experience to the table as well as small improvements.
